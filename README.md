# Guacamole - A backseat driver for ArangoDB

Sometimes the driver of a vehicle needs a little help - some guidance, or extra instructions. This is where a backseat driver comes in. The primary aim of a backseat driver is not to take over the main job of **actually** driving the car, but just to help out a little here and there. In fact, a backseat driver should probably stay out of the way as much as possible, but at times an extra instruction from the back is called for.

With database drivers it can be like that as well. This tool aims to be a backseat driver for [ArangoJS](https://github.com/arangodb/arangojs) - something to be used **alongside** the official driver, to provide a little extra help, but surely not to replace it. In fact, as far as possible the `Backseat Driver` must stay out of the way and let you use the native ArangoJS driver itself - except in some cases where the backseat driver adds additional functionality that may be helpful.

Note: this is primarily a project created for personal use, and therefore very limited in what it attempts to be. It makes a few things easier/simpler *in my own world*, and exists only to serve that purpose. Could perhaps be helpful for others? Probably, but this was the disclaimer.
