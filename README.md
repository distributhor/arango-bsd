# Guacamole - A backseat driver for ArangoDB

Sometimes the driver of a vehicle needs a little help, guidance, or extra instructions. This is where a backseat driver comes in. The primary aim of a backseat driver is not to take over the main job of **actually** driving the vehicle, but just to help out a little. In fact, a backseat driver should probably stay out of the way as much as possible, but at times an extra instruction is needed.

With database drivers it's sometimes like that as well. This tool aims to be a backseat driver for [ArangoJS](https://github.com/arangodb/arangojs) - something to be used alongside it to provide a little extra help, but definitely not to replace it. In fact, as far as possible the `Backseat Driver` will stay out of the way and let you use the native ArangoJS driver itself. But sometimes a little help, or extra instructions and convenience can make it easier to get things done.

This project is currently in development, and should (for the foreseeable future at least) be considered a "pet project". It may take a long time until it reaches a semi-fully featured "V1" non-pet-project state (it may never get there), and will also be subject to random breaking changes until then. Use at own risk.
