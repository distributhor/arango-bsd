# Arango Backseat Driver

Sometimes the driver of a vehicle needs a little help, guidance, or extra instructions. This is where a backseat driver comes in. The primary aim of a backseat driver is not to take over the main job of the driver itself, which is to **actually** control the vehicle, but just to "help out a little". In fact, a backseat driver should probably stay out of the way as much as possible, but sometimes something just _needs to be said_, or an extra instruction may perhaps help to avoid making a turn later in the road.

So it sometimes is with a database driver as well. This tool aims to be just that for the ArangoJS driver - something to be used alongside it where a little extra help is needed, but not to replace it. In fact, as far as possible, the Arango Backseat Driver will stay out of the way and let you use the native ArangoJS driver. But in some cases a little help may needed to get things done.

This project is currently in development, and should (for the foreseeable future at least) be considered a "pet project". It may take a long time until this project reaches a semi-fully featured "V1" non-pet-project state (it may never there), and will also be subject to random breaking changes until then. Still, some of what is released may or may not be useful to other Arango developers, so the progress will be made public along the way, as features are needed by the developer himself. Use at own risk.
