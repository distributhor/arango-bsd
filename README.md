# Guacamole - A backseat driver for ArangoDB

Sometimes the driver of a car needs a little help, guidance, or extra instructions. This is where a backseat driver comes in. The primary aim of a backseat driver is not to take over the main job of **actually** driving the car, but just to help out a little. In fact, a backseat driver should probably stay out of the way as much as possible, but at times an extra instruction from the back is needed.

With database drivers it can sometimes be like that as well. This tool aims to be a backseat driver for [ArangoJS](https://github.com/arangodb/arangojs) - something to be used **alongside** the official driver, to provide a little extra help, but definitely not to replace it. In fact, as far as possible the `Backseat Driver` must stay out of the way and let you use the native ArangoJS driver itself - except in some cases where the backseat driver adds additional functionality that you might be interested in.

Note: this is primarily a project created for own use, and therefore very much limited in what it attempts to be. It makes a few things easier/simpler *in my own world*, and exists only to serve that purpose. This is the disclaimer.
